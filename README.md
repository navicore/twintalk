# TwinTalk - Digital Twin Runtime

An experimental digital twin runtime combining Rust performance with Smalltalk expressiveness for prototype-based twin programming.

## Concept
- **Digital Twins**: Software representations that mirror real-world entities through telemetry
- **Prototype-Based**: Clone and customize twin instances dynamically
- **Smalltalk DSL**: Expressive language for twin behavior definition
- **Rust Runtime**: High-performance, safe execution environment

## Current Status
🔬 **Feasibility Investigation Phase**

See [FEASIBILITY_PLAN.md](FEASIBILITY_PLAN.md) for detailed investigation plan.

## Architecture

The system is organized as a Cargo workspace with three main crates:

- **twintalk-core**: Core runtime engine with twin execution, state management, and Smalltalk DSL interpreter
- **twintalk-api**: HTTP/WebSocket API server for external integration
- **twintalk-supervisor**: Erlang-style supervisor for twin lifecycle, fault tolerance, and restart strategies
