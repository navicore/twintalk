//! TwinTalk Supervisor
//! 
//! Erlang-style supervision trees for twin lifecycle management:
//! - Automatic restart strategies (one-for-one, one-for-all, rest-for-one)
//! - Health monitoring and failure detection
//! - Resource limits and backpressure
//! - Twin spawn/despawn orchestration

// TODO: Implement supervisor functionality
// For now, this is a placeholder to allow compilation
