# Digital Twin Runtime Feasibility Study

## Project Vision
A Rust-based digital twin runtime with Smalltalk as the DSL for programming twins, featuring prototype-based programming for cloning and customizing twin instances.

## Phase 1: Core Technology Investigation

### 1.1 Smalltalk-Rust Integration
- **Option A**: Embed existing Smalltalk VM (e.g., PharoVM, OMeta)
- **Option B**: Build minimal Smalltalk interpreter in Rust
- **Option C**: Transpile Smalltalk subset to Rust
- **Key Questions**:
  - FFI overhead for telemetry updates
  - Memory management boundaries
  - Threading model compatibility

### 1.2 Prototype-Based Programming in Rust
- Investigate trait objects for dynamic behavior
- Explore `Any` trait for runtime type handling
- Study existing prototype-based systems (Self, JavaScript)
- Design clone/delegation mechanisms

### 1.3 Performance Requirements
- Telemetry ingestion rates (events/sec)
- State update latency requirements
- Memory footprint per twin instance
- Concurrent twin execution model

## Phase 2: Proof of Concept Components

### 2.1 Minimal Smalltalk DSL
```smalltalk
"Example twin definition"
Twin subclass: #TemperatureSensor
    instanceVariables: 'temperature threshold alertState'.

TemperatureSensor>>initialize
    super initialize.
    temperature := 20.0.
    threshold := 30.0.
    alertState := false.

TemperatureSensor>>updateTelemetry: aReading
    temperature := aReading.
    (temperature > threshold) ifTrue: [
        alertState := true.
        self notifyObservers
    ].

"Prototype-based cloning example"
sensor := TemperatureSensor new.
customSensor := sensor clone.
customSensor threshold: 25.0.
```

### 2.2 Rust Runtime Architecture

#### Core Runtime (twintalk-core)
- Twin registry and lifecycle management
- Smalltalk interpreter/VM integration
- State persistence and snapshotting
- Message passing between twins
- Telemetry ingestion pipeline

#### API Server (twintalk-api)
- REST endpoints for twin management
- WebSocket for real-time telemetry streaming
- GraphQL for complex state queries (future)
- Authentication and rate limiting

#### Supervisor (twintalk-supervisor)
- Supervision trees for twin hierarchies
- Restart strategies (one-for-one, one-for-all)
- Resource limits and quotas
- Failure detection and recovery

### 2.3 Integration Layer
- Rust → Smalltalk: Twin instantiation, telemetry delivery
- Smalltalk → Rust: State queries, system calls
- Serialization format for twin state

## Phase 3: Technical Experiments

### 3.1 Experiment 1: Smalltalk VM Embedding
- Test embedding PharoVM or similar
- Measure call overhead
- Evaluate memory isolation

### 3.2 Experiment 2: Minimal Interpreter
- Build toy Smalltalk interpreter in Rust
- Support basic message passing
- Implement prototype cloning

### 3.3 Experiment 3: State Management
- Test different state representations
- Benchmark update performance
- Evaluate persistence strategies

## Phase 4: Feasibility Criteria

### 4.1 Must Have
- [ ] Sub-millisecond telemetry processing
- [ ] Safe concurrent twin execution
- [ ] Efficient prototype cloning
- [ ] Stable Rust-Smalltalk boundary

### 4.2 Nice to Have
- [ ] Hot code reloading for twins
- [ ] Visual debugging tools
- [ ] Distributed twin execution

### 4.3 Deal Breakers
- [ ] >10ms telemetry latency
- [ ] Memory leaks at language boundary
- [ ] Unable to safely share state

## Phase 5: Decision Matrix

| Approach | Complexity | Performance | Flexibility | Maintenance |
|----------|------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Embed VM | High | Medium | High | Medium |
| Mini Interpreter | Medium | High | Medium | High |
| Transpiler | Very High | Very High | Low | Low |

## Next Steps
1. Set up Rust project structure

3. Build minimal prototype experiments
4. Measure and evaluate results
5. Make architectural decisions
